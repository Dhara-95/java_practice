# Java Practice 

Learning Java using the [Codeacedemy 'Learn Java'](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) course, as well as other online resources. 

## Notes

### General 

- Java Virtual Machine allows the same code to be run on different operating systems (Windows, Mac or Linux). 
- Files have a ```.java``` extention. 

### Syntax

HelloWorld example:
```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
  }
```
- ```main()``` method within a class lists the program tasks.
- ```String[] args``` is a placeholder for information we want to pass into our program.
- ```println``` is short for “print line” and is used to print the message on the screen (in Terminal).
